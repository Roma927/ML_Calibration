The project trained and calibrated various machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability. The following models were evaluated: **RandomForestClassifier**, **SVC**, **LogisticRegression**, **MLPClassifier**, **GradientBoostingClassifier**, **AdaBoostClassifier**, **GaussianNB**, **DecisionTreeClassifier**, and **KNeighborsClassifier**. Each model was calibrated using two methods: *sigmoid* and *isotonic*. Below are the key results for accuracy before and after calibration:

1. **RandomForestClassifier**:
   - Pre-calibration Accuracy: **57.50%**
   - Post-calibration (Sigmoid): **63.75%**
   - Post-calibration (Isotonic): **71.25%**

2. **SVC**:
   - Pre-calibration Accuracy: **40.00%**
   - Post-calibration (Sigmoid): **43.75%**

Among all models, the **RandomForestClassifier** showed the highest improvement in accuracy post-calibration, particularly with isotonic calibration, achieving **71.25%** accuracy. The **GradientBoostingClassifier** also performed well after isotonic calibration, with an accuracy of **62.50%**. Reliability plots confirmed that calibration enhanced confidence in predicted probabilities, with isotonic calibration generally outperforming sigmoid calibration. Some models, like **AdaBoostClassifier** and **DecisionTreeClassifier**, did not show improvement post-calibration, highlighting the need for further tuning or addressing issues such as label imbalance. Overall, the calibrated models demonstrated better reliability and predictive accuracy.
